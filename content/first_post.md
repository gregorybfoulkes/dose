My name is Greg. I am from South Africa and a passionate technology,, electornics and computer fan. I used to consider myself a coder, until the day I realised I couldnt really code at all and was a bit of a poser really. 
Knowing all the lingo and high level lanagauge capabilities of javascript that was about my lot in the programming life. That was three years ago and a lot has happened in those three years. Not much of it to do with coding.
So here I sit typing this at 34 having to finally sit down and pursue this passion of mine and commit to getting down to it and developing my skills in several domains and over the next 10 years eveolve into a proper dev.
